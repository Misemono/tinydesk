## Tentative Target User:

An individual user who wants to organize or customize own Homepage. <br />
A company or organization that wants to share the Homepage to increase the efficiency of a work. 

## Problem Statement:

Safari and Chrome have very limited options for managing and organizing bookmarks. When a user adds bookmarks, they usually appear unorganized and spread without any meaningful layout. We propose a web application that will serve as a replacement for Safari and Chrome homepages and will allow the user to “pretty up” their startup page and organize their bookmarks, make to-do lists, add customizable widgets, and take notes all in one place.

## Solution:

Our solution is to create a webpage that serves as a startup page on any internet browser. This webpage will allow users to manage their bookmarks by categorizing them into folders. The webpage will also contain widgets for notes, to-do lists, and weather. Users need to sign up to save their bookmarks, notes, and settings. Users will be able to share their to-do lists with other users.
