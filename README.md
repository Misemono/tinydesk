## Problem:
	Safari and Chrome have very poor options for managing and organizing bookmarks. When users add bookmarks, they usually appear unorganized and spread without any meaningful layout. We propose a web application that will serve as a replacement for the Safari and Chrome homepages and will allow users to “pretty up” their startup page and organize their bookmarks, make todo lists, add customizable widgets, and take notes all in one place.
	
## Solution:
	Our solution is to create a webpage that serves as a startup page of any internet browsers. This webpage will allow users to manage their bookmarks by creating folders, divide sections, categorize and more. The webpage will also contain widgets for notes, todo list, and weather. Users need to sign up for the page to keep their settings for next time whenever they open up a new tab. Users will be able to share their todo lists with other users.
