## Target User:

An individual user who wants to increase his browser workflow productivity. It can be a student or a professional who wishes to organize bookmarks and personalize their browser homepage.

## Problem Statement:

Safari and Chrome have very limited options for managing and organizing bookmarks. When the user adds bookmarks, they usually appear unorganized and spread without any meaningful layout.

## Solution:

Our solution is to create a webpage that serves as a startup page on any internet browser. This webpage will allow users to manage their bookmarks by categorizing them into folders. The webpage will also contain widgets for notes, to-do lists, and weather. Users need to sign up to save their bookmarks, notes, and settings.
